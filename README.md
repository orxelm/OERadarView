Simple custom UIView subclass that adds a Radar view to your application. A radar view consisting of a big circle in the middle and a rotating radius line inside.

## Demo
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orxelm/OERadarView/master/assets/oeradarview.gif)


## Installation
### CocoaPods (Soon)

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

### Manually
Just drag OERadarView.swift file to your xcode project and you are good to go.

## Usage
Just add a UIView to your Storyboard/Xib and set its custom class to OERadarView. If you are using IB you will see the view rendered automatically.
Ofcourse, you can always add it in code with two lines of code:
```swift
let radarView = OERadarView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200))
self.view.addSubview(radarView)
````

## Properties
```swift
/// The circle's fill color
public var circleFillColor: UIColor
    
/// The circle's border (stroke) color
public var circleBorderColor: UIColor
    
/// The center point color
public var centerPointColor: UIColor
    
/// The radius line color
public var radiusLineColor: UIColor
```
